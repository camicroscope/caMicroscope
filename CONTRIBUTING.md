# Contributing to caMicroscope
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code [lints](#Use-a-Consistent-Coding-Style).
6. Issue that pull request! (If it's a development related update or fix, make sure you pull request into the `develop` branch)

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD-3 Clause Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD-3 Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope/issues/new/choose).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
- State the device, platform and versions you are running on.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
The coding style is based on [Google's Guidelines](https://github.com/google/styleguide).

* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
* Then try running `npm run lint` for style unification
