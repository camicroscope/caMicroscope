## About

caMicroscope is a HTML5 image viewer optimized for large bio-medical image data viewing, with a strong emphasis on cancer pathology.

The Image Viewer server is based on [IIPImage server](http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/) which is a Fast CGI module and [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) which is a deep zoom image viewer.


## Usage

To use caMicroscope as a standalone application, see [nanoborb](https://github.com/SBU-BMI/Nanoborb/releases).
